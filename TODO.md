A) The "Symmetry" Challenge: try the Decoder (Turning those raw bytes back into a Go struct).

B) The "Proof" Challenge:  learn how to generate a Merkle Proof (showing that a specific Transaction exists in a Batch without sending the whole Batch)?

C) Optimization: see how to make this 10x faster using generalized indices?
